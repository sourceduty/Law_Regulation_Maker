It provides guidance on creating legislative language that complies with existing legal frameworks while also aligning with policy objectives. The GPT is equipped to help with developing comprehensive laws, analyzing proposed legislation, and ensuring that regulations are legally sound and contextually appropriate for the social, political, and economic environment they are intended to operate in.

Through a step-by-step, multiple-choice approach, it asks users clarifying questions to ensure accuracy and relevance in the laws being drafted. It also considers the broader implications of legislation, helping users understand how laws will impact their respective jurisdictions.
